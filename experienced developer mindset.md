An experienced developer tackling your BookMyShow-type system using **SOLID principles** and good **architectural thinking** would approach it **systematically** — balancing **business needs**, **technical design**, and **future extensibility**.

Here's how they’d break it down — **step by step**, thinking like a pro:

---

## 🧠 1. **Clarify Requirements and Boundaries**

- **What exactly should the system do?**
- Confirm core flows: Search → Select Theatre → View Seats → Book → Pay → Lock → Cancel
- Identify **user roles**: `Viewer`, `Admin`

✅ _Outcome: A shared understanding of what needs to be built and for whom._

---

## 🧱 2. **Define High-Level Architecture**

They’d choose an architecture like:

- **Layered (Hexagonal / Clean Architecture)**
- With layers such as:

  - **Controller (UI/entry layer)** — accepts inputs
  - **Service (Business Logic layer)** — executes workflows
  - **Repository (Persistence layer)** — abstracts DB/IO
  - **Domain Model layer** — encapsulates core entities like `Booking`, `Seat`, `Payment`

✅ _Outcome: Loose coupling + clear separation of concerns._

---

## 🧩 3. **Identify Core Entities (Domain Models)**

They’d define classes for:

- `Movie`, `Show`, `Theatre`, `Screen`, `Seat`
- `Viewer`, `Booking`, `Payment`, `SearchCriteria`

> These become **POJOs** (Plain Old Java Objects) with no business logic inside.

✅ _Outcome: Core domain models that represent real-world concepts cleanly._

---

## 🔌 4. **Define Key Interfaces (Abstractions)**

Experienced devs avoid hard coding behavior. They’d create:

- `PaymentGateway`
- `SeatLockProvider`
- `SearchStrategy`

> **Interface-first design** gives room for testing, flexibility, and plug-and-play implementations.

✅ _Outcome: Inversion of dependencies (DIP) → makes code testable and flexible._

---

## 🧠 5. **Break Down Use Cases into Services**

Each use case is mapped to a **Service class**:

- `SearchService` – Search movie, genre, location
- `BookingService` – Manage seat selection + booking
- `SeatService` – Lock/unlock seats
- `PaymentService` – Handle payment workflow
- `AdminService` – Movie management

Each service does **only one job** (SRP).

✅ _Outcome: Smaller, composable, testable units._

---

## 🔁 6. **Use Design Patterns Where Needed**

Patterns used **judiciously**:

- **Strategy Pattern** for `SearchStrategy`, `PaymentGateway`
- **Factory Pattern** for payment object creation
- **Builder Pattern** for complex objects like `Booking`
- **Observer/Publisher-Subscriber** for notifications after booking

✅ _Outcome: System is extendable and behavior is encapsulated properly._

---

## 🧪 7. **Think About Testing Early**

- Every service is designed for **unit testing** via interfaces
- Business logic is tested **without DB or UI**
- Uses **mocked implementations** of `PaymentGateway`, `SeatLockProvider`

✅ _Outcome: High confidence in correctness + regression safety._

---

## 🔒 8. **Edge Cases and Failures**

They’d ask:

- What if a seat gets locked by someone else mid-booking?
- What if payment fails?
- What if the show gets deleted while searching?

And design the system to handle:

- Timeouts
- Lock expirations
- Rollbacks
- Cancellation windows
- Refund policies

✅ _Outcome: Robust, fault-tolerant system_

---

## 🗃️ 9. **Organize the Codebase**

Clean folder structure like:

```
/controller
/service
/model
/repository
/strategy
/exception
/dto
```

Everything small, reusable, and independently deployable/testable.

✅ _Outcome: Scalable and developer-friendly codebase_

---

## 📦 10. **Iterative Development**

An experienced dev never tries to "build it all at once." Instead:

1. Build MVP with minimal features
2. Iterate — add cancel, refund, filters, loyalty, notifications, etc.
3. Use tools like Swagger for APIs, JUnit for tests, and Spring for DI

✅ _Outcome: Fast, focused delivery with flexibility to grow_
