Great — you're now at the ideal stage to design a system that’s clean, maintainable, and extensible.

Since you're asking **how to break down the problem and follow SOLID principles in Java**, here’s a **step-by-step guide** — **no code**, just the right mindset and structure.

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Identify Core Entities (from Use Case Diagram)

Based on your diagram, extract **nouns** as potential **classes/objects**:

- `Viewer`
- `Admin`
- `Movie`
- `Theatre`
- `Screen`
- `Seat`
- `Show`
- `Booking`
- `SearchService`
- `PaymentService`

> These are your **domain models and services**.

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Group by Responsibility (SRP - Single Responsibility Principle)

For each use case, ask: _What is the responsibility?_
This helps assign responsibility **to only one class**.

Examples:

- **`SearchService`** → Only handles searching (movie, genre, location)
- **`TheatreManager`** → Loads theatres and their screens
- **`SeatManager`** → Manages seat availability and locking
- **`BookingService`** → Only books tickets
- **`PaymentProcessor`** → Handles payment flows
- **`AdminService`** → Adds/updates/deletes movie details

---

## 🤝 Step 3: Identify Interfaces (DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle)

Instead of directly depending on low-level classes (e.g., `NetBankingGateway`), **depend on interfaces**.

Example:

```java
interface PaymentGateway {
    boolean processPayment(PaymentRequest request);
}
```

Then inject different implementations: `NetBankingGateway`, `CreditCardGateway`, etc.

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Open-Closed Principle

Your system should be:

> **Open for extension**, but **closed for modification**

For example:

- Want to add a new payment type? Implement `PaymentGateway`
- Want to add a new search filter (e.g., by actor)? Extend `SearchFilterStrategy`

Avoid rewriting existing classes — instead, extend them via abstraction.

---

## 🏗️ Step 5: Liskov Substitution Principle

Make sure any subclass or implementation can **replace its parent/interface** **without breaking logic**.

Example:

- `VipSeat`, `EconomySeat` should both be usable anywhere a `Seat` is expected

---

## 🚦 Step 6: Break Into Packages/Modules (Helps with SRP + DIP)

## ✅ Final Checklist

| Design Concern                                     | Covered? |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| One class = one reason to change? (SRP)            | ✅       |
| Can I extend this without touching old code? (OCP) | ✅       |
| Do subclasses behave like base class? (LSP)        | ✅       |
| Am I depending on interfaces, not concrete? (DIP)  | ✅       |
| Are classes loosely coupled and highly cohesive?   | ✅       |
| Can logic be tested independently?                 | ✅       |
